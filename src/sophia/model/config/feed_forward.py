    """
    Configuration for the feed-forward (FFN) network used in transformer models.

    This configuration is flattened and expects that the activation function is provided as
    an already-instantiated callable. In other words, rather than providing a nested configuration
    (with separate fields for the activation functionâ€™s target class and its initialization arguments),
    the caller should pass the activation function instance directly.

    Attributes:
        target: A fully qualified class name (as a string) of the feed-forward network implementation.
        hidden_size: The hidden size used in the feed-forward network.
        ffn_multiplier: The multiplier used to compute the intermediate dimension.
        activation: An instance of the activation function to be applied between dense layers.
        dropout_rate: The dropout rate applied within the feed-forward network.
